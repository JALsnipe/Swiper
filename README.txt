Assignment 3: A Gestural Video Player

Swiper - A Gesture-Controlled Video Player

NOTES:
Just messing around with the HTML 5 video API currently.
Create a separate canvas for gestures or make gestures work on top of video?
Custom gestures?
Add OGG and FLV video?
Design decisions?
Actually implement gestures/gesture action handler.
